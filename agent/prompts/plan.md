# Create Implementation Plan

Create a detailed implementation plan through an interactive, iterative process. Be skeptical, thorough, and highly collaborative.

## Initial Response

If no task/ticket provided, ask for:
1. Task description or ticket reference
2. Relevant context, constraints, requirements
3. Links to related research

## Process

### Step 1: Context Gathering

1. Read all mentioned files fully (tickets, research docs, related plans)
2. Research the codebase to find relevant files and understand current implementation
3. Cross-reference requirements with actual code
4. Present informed understanding and focused questions
5. Ask the developer for preferences that affect architecture (complexity tolerance, delivery speed vs robustness, and constraints)

### Step 2: Research & Discovery

After clarifications:
- Spawn parallel research for deeper investigation
- Find relevant files, patterns, and conventions
- Present findings and 2-3 design options with tradeoffs
- Explicitly ask the developer to confirm or adjust key technical decisions before writing the plan
- If choosing a default path due to missing input, state assumptions and request confirmation

### Step 3: Plan Structure

Propose phase structure and get feedback before writing details.
At minimum, confirm:
- Architecture approach
- Data model or API contract changes
- Dependency/tooling additions
- Rollout/risk strategy

### Step 4: Write the Plan

Save to `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`:

```markdown
# [Feature] Implementation Plan

## Overview
[Brief description]

## Current State Analysis
[What exists, constraints discovered]

## Desired End State
[Specification and how to verify]
[Define the complete target deliverable. Do not split scope into MVP vs final deliverable; use phased checkpoints toward one end state.]

## What We're NOT Doing
[Out-of-scope items]

## Phase 1: [Name]
### Overview
[What this phase accomplishes]

### Changes Required
**File**: `path/to/file.ext`
**Changes**: [Summary]

### Success Criteria
#### Automated Verification:
- [ ] `make test`
- [ ] `make lint`

#### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Feature works as expected
- [ ] Edge cases verified

**Note**: Pause for human confirmation after this phase before proceeding.

---

## Phase 2: [Name]
[Same structure...]

## References
- Research: `docs/research/[relevant].md`
- Ticket: [reference]
```

### Step 5: Iterate

Present the plan and refine based on feedback.
Do at least one explicit feedback pass focused on technical tradeoffs and alternatives before finalizing.

## Recording Major Decisions

Capture major decisions in `developer-log.md` so an outsider can follow the reasoning over time.

When to log:
- Architecture or integration strategy changes
- Data model, API, or contract decisions
- New dependencies or tooling choices
- Scope cuts/additions that change delivery strategy
- Risky tradeoffs (performance, reliability, security, UX)

If `developer-log.md` does not exist, create it.

Entry format:

```markdown
## [YYYY-MM-DD] [Short decision title]

**Context:** [What decision was needed and why]
**Options considered:** [Option A, Option B, and key tradeoff]
**Decision:** [Chosen option]
**Rationale:** [Why this option was selected]
**Impact:** [What changes as a result]
**Owner:** [Developer / Agent + developer confirmation]
```

Keep entries concise and focused on major decisions only.

## Guidelines

- **Be skeptical**: Question vague requirements, verify with code
- **Be interactive**: Get buy-in at each step and explicitly confirm major technical decisions
- **Be thorough**: Include file:line references, measurable success criteria
- **No open questions**: Resolve all questions before finalizing
